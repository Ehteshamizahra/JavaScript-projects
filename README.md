Pizza Menu
In this project, a menu used to order pizza is created which allows to select various toppings. It then takes the input details and calculates the price for the order.

Tic-Tac-Toe
It's the classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first and then users are off playing the game. The winner is celeberated with music and flashing lights.

Calculator
A basic 4 function calculator is created here. Users can add, subtract, multiply and device on a web version of a calculator.
